This an initial comparision results and notes based on my preliminary findings. I intend to create a web service to post user results and make a full detailed comparision.

## Notes
* Till now, I have not yet got a good result in case of Couchbase Lite, as you can see is painfully slow in all respects. Maybe I am doing something wrong; if so please raise an issue.
* If you find your *beloved* db's performance is not what is expected, feel free to submit a PR. Also, once you get the release apk you could try it out in your devices and report!
* Also, if you find any result way out of proportions, suggest a workaround! :)
